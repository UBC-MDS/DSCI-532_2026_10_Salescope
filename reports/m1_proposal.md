## Section 2: Description of the Data

We will be visualizing the *Sales and Customer Insights* dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset contains 10,000 rows and 15 columns, where each row represents a customer profile with purchasing behavior and sales-related attributes. The data includes customer engagement metrics, revenue indicators, geographic segmentation, and retention-related features that are relevant to understanding customer value and churn patterns.

Key variables include:

- `Purchase_Frequency`: Measures how often a customer makes purchases, helping assess engagement levels.
- `Average_Order_Value`: Represents the average amount spent per transaction and indicates spending behavior.
- `Lifetime_Value`: Estimates the total revenue generated by a customer over time, supporting long-term profitability analysis.
- `Churn_Probability`: Indicates the likelihood of a customer discontinuing engagement, which is critical for retention strategy decisions.
- `Region`: Identifies geographic location, enabling comparison of customer behavior across regions.
- `Season` and `Preferred_Purchase_Times`: Capture temporal purchasing patterns that may influence sales trends.
- `Retention_Strategy`: Describes the strategy currently applied to retain the customer.
- `Most_Frequent_Category`: Captures the product category a customer purchases most often, which helps segment customers by preference and compare retention/churn patterns across categories.
- `Time_Between_Purchases`: Measures the typical gap between purchases and provides a signal of engagement/recency, which may relate to churn risk and retention strategy design.

Using this dataset, we may also derive additional features such as customer value segments (e.g., high-value vs. low-value customers) or churn risk categories to further support comparative analysis. These variables allow our target user to explore purchasing trends, identify high-risk or high-value customers, and evaluate how customer behavior varies across regions and seasons, ultimately supporting data-driven decision-making in customer retention and revenue optimization.


## Section 3: Research Questions & Usage Scenarios

### Usage Scenario

Sarah Chen is a Regional Sales Director for North America at a growing e-commerce company. She wants to understand customer behavior patterns across her territory to make informed decisions about retention budget allocation for the upcoming quarter. With limited resources, she needs to identify which regions show higher churn risk and compare how different retention strategies perform across her territory. This information will help her determine where to invest her budget for maximum impact.

When Sarah opens the Salescope dashboard, she sees an overview of key customer metrics organized by region. She notices that some regions appear to have higher average churn probabilities than others, even when average order values look similar. To investigate further, she filters the dashboard to focus on customers with elevated churn risk. Through this exploration, she discovers that many at-risk customers in certain regions are enrolled in email-based retention campaigns, while other regions with better retention outcomes rely more heavily on loyalty programs.

Sarah continues her analysis by examining how purchase frequency relates to churn probability across different regions. She observes that customers who purchase less frequently tend to show higher churn rates, and the current email-based approach may not be effectively re-engaging these customers. By comparing lifetime value distributions, she identifies opportunities to protect revenue by focusing retention efforts on high-value customers who show warning signs of disengagement.

Based on these insights from the Salescope dashboard, Sarah decides to reallocate a portion of her retention budget away from generic email campaigns in underperforming regions. Instead, she plans to implement targeted loyalty programs for customers who show both low purchase frequency and elevated churn risk. She also schedules a follow-up analysis to measure whether this strategy shift improves retention rates over the next two months.

### User Stories

> **User Story 1:**
> As a **Regional Sales Director**, I want to **compare basic KPIs (such as mean, median, and maximum) for customer lifetime value, average order value, and purchase frequency across different geographic regions** so that I can **identify high-performing regions to replicate best practices and underperforming regions that need intervention**.
> **User Story 2:**
> As a **Customer Success Manager**, I want to **filter customers by churn probability thresholds and analyze which retention strategies (Loyalty Program, Discount, Email Campaign) are most effective for different risk segments** so that I can **proactively intervene with at-risk customers using the most appropriate retention approach**.
> **User Story 3:**
> As an **E-commerce Product Manager**, I want to **visualize sales patterns across product categories (Electronics, Clothing, Sports, Home) and seasons, including preferred purchase times** so that I can **optimize inventory planning for peak seasons and schedule targeted marketing campaigns during high-conversion periods**. 

## Section 4: Exploratory Data Analysis

We focused on User Story 2 to explore whether different retention strategies are working well for customers at risk of churning. The goal was to see if there are patterns that could help Customer Success Managers make better decisions about which retention approach to use for different customer segments.

**Analysis:**

We created a scatter plot (see `notebooks/eda.ipynb`) showing lifetime value on the x-axis and average days between purchases on the y-axis for a sample of 100 customers. Each dot represents one customer, and we used color to show which retention strategy they are currently on (Loyalty Program, Email Campaign, or Discount). We also varied the opacity based on churn probability, so darker dots indicate customers who are more likely to churn.

Looking at the plot, a few things stand out. Customers who wait longer between purchases generally have higher churn risk, which makes sense since they are less engaged. What is more interesting is that we see high-value customers (above $7,000 in lifetime value) spread across all three retention strategies, but quite a few of the high-risk, high-value customers are currently just getting email campaigns. These are customers the company really does not want to lose, but they might need something more engaging than emails to keep them around.

There is also a noticeable cluster of customers with both high churn probability and high lifetime value who have long gaps between purchases. This group is especially important because losing them would mean losing significant revenue.

**Reflection:**

This analysis shows why the dashboard filtering features from User Story 2 will be useful. Right now, it is hard to spot these mismatches between customer risk levels and retention strategies without digging through the data manually. If a Customer Success Manager can filter by churn probability and compare how different strategies perform, they can quickly identify customers who might benefit from switching from email campaigns to loyalty programs or discounts.

The dashboard will make it easier to find these opportunities and take action before valuable customers churn.
