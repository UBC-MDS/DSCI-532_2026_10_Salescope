## Section 2: Description of the Data

We will be visualizing the *Sales and Customer Insights* dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset contains 10,000 rows and 15 columns, where each row represents a customer profile with purchasing behavior and sales-related attributes. The data includes customer engagement metrics, revenue indicators, geographic segmentation, and retention-related features that are relevant to understanding customer value and churn patterns.

Key variables include:

- `Purchase_Frequency`: Measures how often a customer makes purchases, helping assess engagement levels.
- `Average_Order_Value`: Represents the average amount spent per transaction and indicates spending behavior.
- `Lifetime_Value`: Estimates the total revenue generated by a customer over time, supporting long-term profitability analysis.
- `Churn_Probability`: Indicates the likelihood of a customer discontinuing engagement, which is critical for retention strategy decisions.
- `Region`: Identifies geographic location, enabling comparison of customer behavior across regions.
- `Season` and `Preferred_Purchase_Times`: Capture temporal purchasing patterns that may influence sales trends.
- `Retention_Strategy`: Describes the strategy currently applied to retain the customer.
- `Most_Frequent_Category`: Captures the product category a customer purchases most often, which helps segment customers by preference and compare retention/churn patterns across categories.
- `Time_Between_Purchases`: Measures the typical gap between purchases and provides a signal of engagement/recency, which may relate to churn risk and retention strategy design.

Using this dataset, we may also derive additional features such as customer value segments (e.g., high-value vs. low-value customers) or churn risk categories to further support comparative analysis. These variables allow our target user to explore purchasing trends, identify high-risk or high-value customers, and evaluate how customer behavior varies across regions and seasons, ultimately supporting data-driven decision-making in customer retention and revenue optimization.
