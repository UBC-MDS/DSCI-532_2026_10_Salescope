# DSCI-532_2026_10_Salescope

## Overview

Salescope is an interactive dashboard that helps e-commerce businesses understand their customers better and reduce churn. Regional sales directors can compare performance across different territories, while customer success managers can identify at-risk customers and evaluate which retention strategies work best. The dashboard visualizes purchasing patterns by product category, season, and customer segment to support data-driven decisions about inventory planning and marketing campaigns.

## Dataset

We use the [Sales and Customer Insights](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imranalishahh/sales-and-customer-insights) dataset from Kaggle, which contains 10,000 customer records with purchasing behavior and engagement metrics.
